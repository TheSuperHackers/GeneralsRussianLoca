Command & Conquer™ Generals
Terms of Service for Online Features
 
These terms of service govern your use of 
Command & Conquer Generals Online Features 
(the “Service”), which Electronic Arts (“EA”) 
makes available to you. You should periodically 
check here for rules and for updates and new 
information. All of our services, regardless 
of when they are added, are governed by our 
Terms of Service. 
 
Appropriate Online Content.
 
By "Content," we mean the software, 
communications, images, sounds, and 
all the material and information you see 
or use on our Service. EA, our users, our 
affiliates, and our independent content 
providers provide most of the Content 
on the Service. EA does not pre-screen 
all Content available on our Service. 
EA does not assume any responsibility or 
liability for Content that is provided 
by users.  EA does not endorse, approve, 
or prescreen any Content that you or other 
users communicate on the Service. We 
reserve the right to remove Content that 
is objectionable to us for any reason. 
Neither EA nor its affiliates assume 
any liability for any failure to remove, 
or any delay in removing, Content. You 
bear the entire risk of the completeness, 
accuracy or usefulness of Content found 
on our Service.
 
Content must reflect our standards, and we may 
remove it if, in our best judgment, it does not 
meet those standards. When we do, you may 
receive a warning from us if you were responsible 
for posting the offensive Content. If it's a 
serious offense or you've violated our rules 
before, we may ban you from participating in 
the Service.
 
Strong vulgar language, crude or explicit 
sexual references, discussions of illegal drugs,
and hate speech are offensive and always 
inappropriate Content for the Service. In other 
cases, there may be "gray areas". Always use your 
best judgment. If you would not say something 
in a room full of people you have never met, or 
in the workplace, please don't post it on our 
Service. EA makes the final determination about 
whether Content is objectionable or not. This 
determination is in our sole discretion, and is final.
 
EA representatives may monitor your communications 
on the Service. But, because we cannot monitor 
all of the Content, and we do not attempt to 
do so, you might encounter something you 
don't want to see. You can report it to the 
game support. Your good judgment in making 
reports, particularly about the opinions of 
others, is important and appreciated. EA does not 
endorse or oppose the opinions of any user, but we 
may take issue with the manner in which an 
opinion is expressed.
 
Online Conduct.
 
You agree that you will be personally responsible 
for your use of the Service and for all of your 
communication and activity on the Service, 
including any Content you contribute, and 
that you will indemnify and hold harmless EA, 
its subsidiaries, affiliates, employees, officers, 
and directors from any liability or damages 
arising from your conduct on the Service, including 
any Content that you contribute. Online conduct 
should be guided by common sense and basic etiquette. 
You will violate the Terms of Service if you 
(or others using your game) do any of the following:
 
• Post, transmit, promote, or distribute Content 
that is illegal.
 
• Harass, threaten, embarrass, or do anything else 
to another user that is unwanted. This means: don't 
say bad things about them, don't keep sending them 
unwanted messages, don't attack their race, 
sexual orientation, religion, heritage, etc. If 
you disagree with someone, respond to the subject, 
not the person. 
 
• Transmit or facilitate distribution of Content 
that is harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically 
offensive, vulgar, sexually explicit, defamatory, 
infringing, invasive of personal privacy or 
publicity rights, or in a reasonable person's view, 
objectionable. Hate speech is not tolerated.
 
• Disrupt the flow of chat with vulgar language, 
abusiveness, hitting the return key repeatedly or 
inputting large images so the screen goes by too 
fast to read, use of excessive shouting [all caps] 
in an attempt to disturb other users, or flooding 
[posting repetitive text]. This is online vandalism, 
and it ruins the experience for others.
 
• You may not impersonate another person 
(including celebrities); indicate that you are 
an EA employee or a representative of EA, or 
attempt to mislead users by indicating that you 
represent EA, Westwood, or any of EA's partners 
or affiliates.
 
• Attempt to get a password, other account 
information, or other private information from 
a user on the Service. Remember: EA employees 
will NEVER ask for your password. Don't give your 
password, reminder words, or personal information 
out to anyone.
  
• Upload any software or Content that you do 
not own or have permission to freely distribute
 
• Promote or encourage any illegal activity 
including hacking, cracking or distribution of 
counterfeit software;
 
• Upload files that contain a virus or corrupted data; 
 
• Post messages for any purpose other than personal 
communication, or transmit advertising, promotional 
materials, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or make 
any commercial use of our Service. 
 
• Improperly use the game support or make false 
reports to EA staff about other users.
 
 
Obey the rules wherever you are. This includes 
rules for use of third party tools, and rules 
of interactive service providers, state, local, 
federal laws, or foreign or international law 
where appropriate. Ignorance of the law is no excuse. 
Other services have their own rules, and you 
should consult them before interacting.
 
Illegal behavior. 
 
 
The laws that apply in the offline world must be 
obeyed online as well. We have zero tolerance for 
illegal behavior on the Service. We terminate 
use of the Service and cooperate with law 
enforcement on such matters.
 
 
Connecting to the Service; Public Nature of 
Communications.
 
 
When you connect to the Service, we may retrieve 
information from the computer used to log onto 
the Service about the computer's hardware system 
and any data related to the computer's operation 
of EA Software. We will not collect any personal 
information about you, however, without your 
knowledge and consent as stated in our Privacy 
Policy at www.ea.com.
 
You acknowledge and agree that your 
communications with other users via chats, 
conferences, bulletin boards, and any other avenues 
of communication on this Service are public and not 
private communications, and that you have no 
expectation of privacy concerning your use of 
this Service. You acknowledge that personal 
information that you communicate on this Service 
may be seen and used by others and result in 
unsolicited communications, therefore we strongly 
encourage you not to disclose any personal 
information about yourself in your public 
communications on our Service. EA is not 
responsible for information that you choose 
to communicate to other users on the Service, 
or for the actions of other users.
 
Commercial Activity and Unsolicited E-mail. 
 
 
You may not advertise any goods or services on the 
Service. Chain letters and pyramid schemes are not 
allowed. You may not use any areas of the Service 
to collect information, including login names, 
about users, and use of such information to send 
unsolicited e-mail or for any other purpose is 
strictly prohibited. You may not exploit the 
Service for any commercial purpose. If you violate 
our terms, we may prohibit you from using the 
Service and/or take further legal action. 
  
Copyrights and Trademarks; Proprietary Rights.
 
 
EA’s content is owned by EA and our licensors, 
and is protected by copyrights, trademarks, and 
other intellectual property rights. It is very 
easy to copy things in cyberspace, but that doesn't 
make it acceptable or legal. You may not copy or 
download any Content from the Service unless we 
have expressly authorized you to do so.

You must also have the legal right to upload 
any Content to the Service before you do so. You 
shall not copy, transmit, modify, distribute, show 
in public or in private, modify or create any 
derivative works from the Content you find on the 
Service, unless EA expressly authorizes you to do 
so. Making unauthorized copies of any Content found 
on the Service can lead to the revocation of your 
ability to use the Service and may subject you to further 
legal action. Similarly, other content owners may take 
criminal or civil action against you. In that event, 
you agree to indemnify and hold harmless EA and 
its subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies, 
employees, officers, directors and agents.

Once you post or send any Content to the Service, 
you expressly grant EA the complete and irrevocable 
right to quote, re-post, use, reproduce, modify, 
distribute, transmit, broadcast, and otherwise 
communicate, and publicly display and perform the 
Content in any form, anywhere, with or without 
attribution you in EA's discretion, and without 
any notice or compensation to you of any kind.
 
EA Software.
 
 
EA grants to you a non-exclusive, limited license 
to use EA’s software (“EA Software”) to play games 
on our Service. You may not sub-license, or charge 
others to use or access EA Software. You may not 
use EA Software for any other purpose. You may not 
translate, reverse-engineer, reverse-compile or 
decompile, disassemble or make derivative works 
from EA Software. You may not modify EA Software 
or use it in any way not expressly authorized 
in writing by EA. You understand that EA's 
introduction of various technologies may not be 
consistent across all platforms and that the 
performance and some features offered by EA may 
vary depending on your computer and other 
equipment.

EA HAS NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND OR 
NATURE IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF 
THE EA SOFTWARE (INCLUDING LIABILITY FOR 
ANY CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES 
OR DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER HARDWARE OR 
SOFTWARE), AND THE ENTIRE RISK OF USE 
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY DAMAGE 
TO YOUR COMPUTER HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE) 
RESIDES WITH YOU.
 
EA Software may be subject to United 
States export controls. If you download 
EA Software from EA, you warrant that you 
are not located in any country, or 
exporting EA Software to any person or 
place, to which the United States has 
embargoed goods.

ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND 
"AS AVAILABLE" BASIS FOR YOUR USE, 
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, UNLESS SUCH 
WARRANTIES ARE LEGALLY INCAPABLE OF

A COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE BASIS AND 
DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL BE 
ABLE TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE AT 
TIMES OR LOCATIONS OF YOUR CHOOSING, 
OR THAT EA WILL HAVE ADEQUATE CAPACITY 
FOR THE SERVICE AS A WHOLE OR IN ANY 
SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC AREA. EA MAY 
CANCEL THE SERVICE AND/OR LIMIT YOUR 
USE OF THE SERVICE AT ANYTIME.
 
 
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR 
SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY 
DISPUTE WITH EA ABOUT THE SERVICE IS

ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT EA, ITS 
SUBSIDIARIES, AND AFFILIATES ARE NOT 
LIABLE FOR ANY ACT OR FAILURE TO ACT 
BY THEM OR ANY OTHER PERSON REGARDING

THE SERVICE OR USE OF EA SOFTWARE. IN 
NO CASE SHALL EA'S OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES', 
AFFILIATES', EMPLOYEES', OFFICERS', OR

LIABILITY TO YOU EXCEED THE AMOUNT, IF 
ANY, THAT YOU PAID TO EA FOR THE SERVICE 
AND/OR THE EA SOFTWARE. IN NO CASE SHALL 
EA OR EA AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES 
ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, 
EA SOFTWARE, THE INTERNET OR FOR ANY 
OTHER CLAIM RELATED IN ANY WAY TO YOUR

BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS 
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE 
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL 
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES 
OR JURISDICTIONS, EA'S AND EA AFFILIATES' 
LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULL 
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. EA DOES NOT 
ENDORSE, WARRANT OR GUARANTEE ANY THIRD 
PARTY PRODUCT OR SERVICE OFFERED
THROUGH THE SERVICE AND WILL NOT BE 
A PARTY TO OR IN ANY WAY BE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR MONITORING ANY TRANSACTION BETWEEN
YOU AND THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF
