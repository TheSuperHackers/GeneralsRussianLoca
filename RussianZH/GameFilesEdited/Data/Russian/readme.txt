2. TROUBLE SHOOTING

      2.1. Before You Start:

Before running Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour, be sure that you have the latest drivers for your video and audio cards installed onto your PC. You can download the appropriate drivers from your video and audio card manufacturer's Web site. 

Be sure that you have disabled anti-aliasing in your Windows display properties before running Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour. Leaving this feature enabled might conflict with some of the game's effects. 

Do not run any other programs in the background, as this may conflict with Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour. This includes any virus-protection program that you have running.

If you should experience problems running Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour after changing something in the game's Options, you can always revert back to the default settings by deleting the "options.ini" file. If you're running Windows XP, you can find this file by double-clicking "My Computer" icon, opening the "My Documents" folder, and then opening the "Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour Data" directory. 

If you're running Windows 98, 98SE, ME, or 2000, simply double-click on the "My Documents" folder located on your Windows desktop, and then open the folder named "Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour Data." The "options.ini" file will be located in there. 

Do not attempt to install Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour on a network drive, as the game will not install properly. When installing Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour, the game will prompt you with a default installation directory. It is highly recommended that you install the game to that default directory.

The minimum required system specifications to run Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour is as follows:

If you attempt to run Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour with any of the video cards listed above, you may encounter a "Serious Error" message. Additionally, Some Nvidia GeForce 2 MX owners may experience some stuttering problems during movies. 

If you attempt to run Zero Hour at 1600x1200 with a 32MB Nvidia GeForce 2 video card, the game may crash to the desktop. If this happens, try reducing the game's resolution.

On some computers, supported ATI video cards will cause occasional graphics artifacts to appear onscreen briefly. Make sure that you have the latest drivers installed.

If you are running under Windows 98, have an ATI Radeon 9200 video card installed, and are experiencing random crashes, add a "-noshaders" command line to your Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour shortcut. To do so, right-click on the "Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour" icon on your Windows Desktop, choose "Properties", and add -noshaders to the end of the path in the "Target" field. If you installed the game to the default directory, the command line should like this: "C:\Program Files\EA Games\Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour\generals.exe" -noshaders

Under all resolutions, you may experience that some objects like trees, walls, and pillars will flicker briefly. If this happens, saving and reloading your game will resolve the issue.


      2.4. Known Sound Card Issues:

Before running Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour, be sure that you have your sound card's latest drivers installed onto your PC. You can download the appropriate audio drivers from your sound card manufacturer's Web site. 

Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour does not support any ISA sound cards. If you own an ISA sound card, you will experience stuttering or dropped sound effects as well as frequent pauses during gameplay. 



      2.5. Virtual Memory Settings:
       
Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour may need to use more RAM than is present on your system. Windows will automatically take care of this by using what is known as "Virtual Memory," which uses space on your hard disk to simulate the memory it needs and swaps data back and forth from your hard disk as required. Ensure that the maximum setting is at least 512MB.
      
      
      2.6. AutoPlay:
       
If the Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour "Disc 1" CD does not AutoPlay when inserted in the drive, you may have this feature disabled. To enable AutoPlay, please consult your Windows user manual.

If you are running Windows XP, AutoPlay should be always enabled. You can customize your AutoPlay options by opening "My Computer," and right clicking on your CD-ROM or DVD Drive icon and choosing "Properties," and then selecting the "AutoPlay" tab. If AutoPlay doesn't work properly, please consult your Windows XP user manual.


      2.7. East Asian Fonts:
       
All players who use a Western version of Windows will see boxes in place of Asian text in the Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour online lobby. If you are running Windows XP, you can install the Asian language font pack by opening your Control Panel in Windows, double-clicking on the "Regional and Language Options" icon, selecting the "Languages" tab, and checking the "Install files for East Asian Languages" box. You will be asked for your Windows XP CD, and you will need to restart your PC. Once this process has been done, be sure that the "Asian Text" option has been selected under your "Persona" screen in Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour's "Online" menu.



      2.8. Game Updates and Patches:
       
Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour contains an auto-update feature that will automatically let you know when new patches and updates are available to you. When an update to the game is available, you will be prompted to download and install it when you click on "Multiplayer" and then "Online" from the game's main menu. If you don't intend to play Zero Hour online, but still wish to download the latest updates, you can either log onto the official Command & Conquer Generals Web site at generals.ea.com or choose the "Check for Updates" option from the Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour AutoRun feature. 


      2.9. NETGEAR Firewalls:

If you are running a NETGEAR firewall and are unable to connect to other players while in the Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour multiplayer lobby, check the "Send Delay" box under the "Network Options" portion of the game's "Options" menu. 

If you have made changes to your firewall configuration since the last time that you played Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour online and are experiencing connection difficulties, click the "Refresh NAT" box under the "Network Options" portion of the game's "Option" menu. It is highly recommended that you click this box every time you change your Internet or firewall settings. 

If you are running Windows XP and are having trouble connecting to other players online, check to make sure that your Windows XP firewall setting isn't turned on. Windows XP defaults this setting to on. To check this setting, open your Windows' "Control Panel" and double-click on the "Network Connections" icon. Right-click on your active connection, choose "Properties" from the menu, and then click on the "Advanced" tab.  Make sure that the box underneath "Internet Connection Firewall", which is labeled "Protect my computer and network..." is unchecked.

If your firewall does not allow outgoing packets to open ports to incoming traffic, or you experience problems connecting to other players, you will have to specify which port you want Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour to use for communicating with other players.  You can specify that port in the "Firewall Port Override" field under the "Network Options" portion of the game's "Options" menu.
 
You will need to open the chosen port in your firewall for communication with players external to your firewall or NAT device.  If you use the port override feature, the port you have chosen can not be masqueraded by a NAT device.

The game will need to talk to external servers that use the following port numbers.  These ports need to be open in your firewall in order to play on Generals Zero Hour Online:
 
TCP ports:
80, 6667, 28910, 29900, 29920
 
UDP ports:
4321, 27900

Other Routers

NOTE: Before applying any changes to your router configuration, review the documentation that came with the router. Also note that making any changes to your router could have adverse effects on your current network configuration if done improperly. It's generally a good idea to record your current settings before making any changes.
